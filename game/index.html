        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Dig Dug is a <strong>1-2 player</strong> arcade game in which you have to use your shovel to dig your way through the earth.
            <br>Stopping you from doing this are two monsters, called <em>Pooka</em> and <em>Fygar</em>, who will continually chase you around.
            <br>The only weapon that you carry is an air pump, which you can use to inflate the monsters to the point where they explode. [...]
